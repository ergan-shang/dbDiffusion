This repository provides codes for conducting dbDiffusion in predicting unseen perturbations, which exploits biological similarities in gene expression profiles and relationships among perturbations.

dbDiffusion model is a generative framework that integrates diffusion models with classifier-free guidance derived from perturbation information, operating in latent space through a variational autoencoder (VAE).
